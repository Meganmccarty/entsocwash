There are two HTML files in the template directory: a sample home page, and a generic page that is customizable.

The home page plays with the color palette and some sample fonts (listed in the assets directory). There is a sample image carousel in place, as I thought the home page needed some images. (All images used are mine and are available for licensing on Alamy.)

The generic page has a bunch of text-block components and headers in differing layouts. The idea is that an editor can edit a page in the CMS and can not only change the content but can choose how to lay it out on the page. This will reduce the number of templates needed to create the website and give the ESW more control over how the website will look as content is added, changed, and removed over time.
